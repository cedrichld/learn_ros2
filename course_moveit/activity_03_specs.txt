Instructions for Activity 03:

Load the existing configuration inside the Moveit Setup Assistant. Then, follow those steps and try to make something that works:
- Re-generate self-collision matrix
- Add a planning group for the gripper
- Create a few poses: gripper_open, gripper_closed, gripper_half_closed
- Add an end effector
- Add ros2_control state interface for gripper_left_finger_joint
- Add a ROS 2 and Moveit controller for the gripper (follow joint trajectory)

Once you're done with the configuration, you can re-generate the package, fix the velocity/acceleration limits, and try to launch the demo.launch.py. If you get some errors, try to fix them using the logs. If you can’t fix them, no worries, check out the next video for the solution.
